But because of his demigod child who almost destroyed the world, he is sent to New York as a mortal and loses all of his powers. Right away he is mugged and then becomes a servant of a demigod child. He has to do all the things his new master ( the demigod child) orders him to do. From one of the most powerful gods to a puny mortal serving a child, Apollo has to complete his task and earn the favor of Zeus again. But with no godly powers and no gods helping him, Apollo's chance for survival doesn't look so great. Can Apollo return to OLympus to regain his powers as a god or will he die as a mortal?",
